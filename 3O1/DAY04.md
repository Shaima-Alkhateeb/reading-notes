# Class 04 :React and Forms

(React and Forms)

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
--> is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state, and its can only updated with setState().
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
--> update the state with their responses as soon as they enter, I dont know.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
-->Because the handler runs on every keystroke to update the React state.

(The Conditional "Ternary" Operator Explained)

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
--> Because it's short and simple compared with if else block.
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
