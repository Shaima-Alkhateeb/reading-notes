# SQL database, ORM, Sequelize

## What's the difference between SQL  and NoSQL?

SQL: Structured Query Language 

NoSQL: not only SQL

| SQL | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS) | primarily called non-relational or distributed database |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) queries are focused on the collection of documents|
| scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware | scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load |

## What is Sequlize and how to use it with Node js?

Sequelize is a promise-based, Node.js ORM (Object-relational mapping) for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication, and more.

Also is an Object Relational Mapper for Node. js. Sequelize lets us connect to a database and perform operations without writing raw SQL queries. It abstracts SQL queries and makes it easier to interact with database models as objects.


## What is an ORM, how does it work, and how should I use one?

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique in which a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database. Object code is written in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java or C#. ORM converts data between type systems that are unable to coexist within relational databases and OOP languages.
