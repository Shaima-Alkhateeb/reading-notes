# Graphs

> ## What is the meaning of Graphs?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.



> ### What is the types of Graphs:
1. Finite Graphs
2. Infinite Graph
3. Trivial Graph 
4. Simple Graph
5. Multi Graph
6. Null Graph
7. Complete Graph
8. Pseudo Graph
9. Regular Graph
10. Bipartite Graph
11. Labeled Graph
12. Digraph Graph
13. Subgraph
14. Connected or Disconnected Graph
15. Cyclic Graph
16. Subgraphs

> ## Difference between graph and tree:

> A graph is a collection of two sets V and E where V is a finite non-empty set of vertices and E is a finite non-empty set of edges.
- Vertices are nothing but the nodes in the graph.

- Two adjacent vertices are joined by edges.

- Any graph is denoted as G = {V, E}.

> A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that
- There is a specially designated node called root.
- The remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint sets T1, T2, T3, â€¦, Tn
